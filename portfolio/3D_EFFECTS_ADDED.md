## ✅ Testing Your 3D Effects

### View in Browser:
The dev server should be running. Visit:
**http://localhost:3000**

If not running, start it:
```bash
cd portfolio
npm start
```

### What to Look For:

1. **Rainbow Particles** 🌈
   - You should see thousands of colorful dots floating in the background
   - They should have a gentle floating animation

2. **3D Shapes** 🔷
   - Three geometric shapes rotating slowly
   - Wireframe style with glowing edges
   - Cyan, purple, and pink colors

3. **Mouse Interaction** 🖱️
   - Move your mouse around the screen
   - The camera should subtly follow your movement
   - Creates a parallax/depth effect

4. **Performance** ⚡
   - Should run smoothly at 60fps
   - No lag or stuttering
   - Responsive on desktop

---

## 🎨 Layer Order

The visual effects are layered in this order:

```
┌─ Front (z-50) ──────────────────────┐
│  Navigation Bar                      │
├─ Content (z-10) ────────────────────│
│  Hero, Skills, Projects, etc.        │
├─ Gradient Orbs (z-0) ───────────────│
│  Cursor-following orbs               │
├─ Neural Network (z-0) ──────────────│
│  80 connected nodes                  │
├─ 3D Background (z-0) ───────────────│
│  Particles + 3D Shapes (NEWEST!)     │
└─ Base (black background) ───────────┘
```

All background effects are set to `pointer-events-none` so they don't interfere with clicking/interactions.

## 🎛️ Performance Optimization

### Current Settings (Balanced):
- **Particles**: 5000
- **Shape Detail**: Medium
- **Opacity**: 30% (subtle)
- **Auto-rotate**: Enabled (0.2 speed)

### If Performance is Slow:

**Option 1: Reduce Particles**
```javascript
// In ThreeBackground.js, change:
const particleCount = 2000; // From 5000
```

**Option 2: Simplify Shapes**
```javascript
// Reduce geometry detail:
<torusKnotGeometry args={[3, 1, 64, 8]} /> // From [3, 1, 128, 16]
```

**Option 3: Disable Effects**
```javascript
// In App.js, comment out any effect:
// <ThreeBackground />     // 3D effects
// <NeuralNetwork />       // Neural network
// <GradientOrbs />        // Gradient orbs
```

---

## 🎨 Quick Customizations

### Change Particle Colors to Brand Colors Only:

```javascript
// In ThreeBackground.js, Particles component:
// Replace rainbow colors with:
const colors = [
  new THREE.Color('#06b6d4'), // Cyan
  new THREE.Color('#a855f7'), // Purple
  new THREE.Color('#ec4899')  // Pink
];
const color = colors[i % colors.length];
colors[i * 3] = color.r;
colors[i * 3 + 1] = color.g;
colors[i * 3 + 2] = color.b;
```

### Make Shapes More Visible:

```javascript
<meshStandardMaterial
  opacity={0.5}           // From 0.3 to 0.5
  emissiveIntensity={1.0} // From 0.5 to 1.0
/>
```

### Add More Shapes:

See `3D_EFFECTS_GUIDE.md` for examples of adding spheres, cubes, cones, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: White/Black screen
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Ensure WebGL is supported.

### Issue: Particles not visible
**Solution:** Increase opacity and emissive intensity in code.

### Issue: Performance lag
**Solution:** Reduce particle count to 2000 or less.

### Issue: Shapes spinning too fast
**Solution:** Decrease rotation multiplier (e.g., 0.3 → 0.1).

## ✨ Pro Tips

1. **Test on Mobile**: 3D effects work on mobile too, but may need reduced particle count
2. **Customize Colors**: Match your brand by changing particle colors
3. **Add More Shapes**: Easy to add spheres, cubes, etc. (see guide)
4. **Adjust Subtlety**: Increase/decrease opacity based on preference
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use Chrome DevTools to check FPS
