# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility Error ✅ FIXED

**Error:**
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

**Root Cause:**
- Tailwind CSS v4 (4.1.14) was installed, which has breaking changes
- Create React App's PostCSS configuration is designed for Tailwind v3
- Tailwind v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` package

**Solution:**
- Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 (stable and compatible)
- Updated PostCSS to v8.4.35
- Updated Autoprefixer to v10.4.17
- Removed node_modules and reinstalled with `--legacy-peer-deps`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `package.json`:
  ```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.17",
    "postcss": "^8.4.35",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1"
  }
  ```

## Issue 2: ESLint Warnings - Unused Variables ✅ FIXED

**Warning:**
```
Line 518:10:  'formData' is assigned a value but never used
Line 518:20:  'setFormData' is assigned a value but never used
Line 579:10:  'formData' is assigned a value but never used
Line 579:20:  'setFormData' is assigned a value but never used
```

**Root Cause:**
- `EducationTab` and `BlogsTab` components had `useState` declarations
- These state variables were initialized but never used in the component logic
- These were placeholder code for future enhancements

**Solution:**
- Commented out the unused `useState` declarations
- Components still function correctly
- Can be uncommented when full CRUD functionality is added

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.js`:
  - Commented out unused `formData` state in `EducationTab`
  - Commented out unused `formData` state in `BlogsTab`
